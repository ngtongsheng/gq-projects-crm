# Decisions

Loop 01 decisions: see `docs/loops/01-foundation/loop.md` (D1-D12).

## Context
- Client: Vicky, owner of a 17-person carpet sales + installation company. Team is non-technical.
- Product: invite-only internal CRM. Vicky vibe-codes it herself via Claude Desktop (Code mode); more editors may follow.
- Owner (ngtongsheng) builds the foundation and the setup, hosts everything on his accounts during evaluation, transfers at handover.

## Loop 02 inputs (setup skill + first run), decided 2026-11-01
- Mac first (Vicky's laptop is a Mac). Windows (winget path) in a later loop when a Windows teammate can test.
- No Homebrew (needs a typed admin password). Git via Apple's click-to-install popup; mise via user-level installer for node, pnpm, gh.
- No ZIP. Bootstrap: Vicky pastes one message into Claude Desktop pointing at a public `ngtongsheng/gq-setup` repo
  (instructions only, no secrets); Claude follows it. Fallback: public plugin marketplace. Verify both in #02 spike.
- Setup covers: GitHub account creation (plain steps), owner invites her to the repo, `gh auth login` (browser device flow), clone, install, first preview.
- After clone, the in-repo kit (CLAUDE.md, skills) takes over; updates arrive with every pull.
- Vicky on Claude Pro; upgrade later. Owner present in person for the first run on her Mac. No separate test rig.
- After handover: replace the CI destructive-change block with Claude double-confirming with Vicky.
- At handover: move to Vicky's paid Vercel Pro + Supabase Pro (commercial use, backups), company GitHub org.

## Loop 03
CRM features: to be grilled after loop 02. Source: Vicky's prototype `docs/mockup/gq-crm-mockup.html` (team roster
and roles, lead pipeline, customers/designers, site activities, projects + payment claims, purchasing/POs with
supplier and warehouse statuses, deliveries, installation schedule and installers, stock/offcuts and returns, staff
OT claims, guide). The prototype is the spec input, not the data model: grill it into slices.
